# Overview

This program parses through a text file and counts the occurrences of each word.
Afterwards it will display the list of words and the number of occurrences.

I wrote this program to explore C++ and learn how it differs from other programs I have written.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code

C++ using the standard library
